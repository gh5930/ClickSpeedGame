Simplest android game.


 In this game you should keep a "living state" of the person by tapping corresponding buttons. 
 While buttons' numbers is green, the person is alive, but if you loose you attention, you may loose persons' life. 
 White color means unsufficent amount of living energy, but yellow means it's abundance. Both is not good, because 0 and 100 will result in death.
